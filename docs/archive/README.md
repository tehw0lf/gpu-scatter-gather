## Why Archived?

These documents served important purposes during development but are now:
1. **Superseded**: Information consolidated into DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md
2. **Session-specific**: Temporary planning documents
3. **Raw data**: Processed and summarized in published docs

## For Historical Research

If you need to understand the development timeline or specific decisions made during development, these documents provide detailed context that has been summarized in the main documentation.
