# 12-Character Password Profiling Results (2025-11-17)

## Test Configuration
- Pattern: ?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?l?d?d?d?d (8 lowercase + 4 digits)
- Batch size: 100M words
- GPU: RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (CC 8.9)

## Performance Metrics
- **Memory Throughput**: 95.01% ⚠️ MEMORY-BOUND!
- **Compute (SM) Throughput**: 17.91%
- **Achieved Occupancy**: 96.34%
- **Theoretical Occupancy**: 100%
- **SM Busy**: 17.02%

## Key Findings

### 🚨 STILL MEMORY-BOUND (95% memory throughput!)
Even with 12-character words (more compute per word), the kernel remains 
heavily memory-bound. This is WORSE than the 4-char case (97% memory).

### Compute Underutilization
- Only 17.91% compute utilization
- SMs are 83% idle waiting for memory
- High occupancy (96%) but low SM utilization

### Profiler Warning
"All compute pipelines are under-utilized. Either this workload is very small 
or it doesn't issue enough warps per scheduler."

## Root Cause Analysis

The 95% memory throughput with 12-char words indicates:
1. **Memory writes are STILL the bottleneck** (not reads - shared memory fixed that)
2. **Longer words = more bytes to write** (13 bytes vs 5 bytes per word)
3. **Write coalescing may be poor** - threads writing to non-contiguous addresses

## Next Optimization Priorities

### Priority 1: Improve Write Coalescing
**Problem**: Each thread writes (word_length + 1) bytes to separate locations
- 12-char: tid * 13 bytes = potentially unaligned, non-coalesced writes

**Solutions**:
a) Pad output to 16-byte alignment (13 → 16 bytes per word)
b) Use shared memory staging + cooperative writes
c) Restructure output buffer for better coalescing

**Expected gain**: 2-5x (could reduce memory throughput from 95% to 20-40%)

### Priority 2: Barrett Reduction
Now lower priority since compute is only 18% utilized.
Only worth pursuing after fixing memory bottleneck.

### Priority 3: Increase Batch Size
The profiler suggests the workload may be too small.
Test with 500M-1B word batches to saturate the GPU better.

## Performance Breakdown (100M × 12-char words)
- **Observed total**: 228ms (no profiling)
- **Memory throughput**: 95% saturated
- **Compute throughput**: 18% utilized
- **Bottleneck**: Memory writes (uncoalesced)
